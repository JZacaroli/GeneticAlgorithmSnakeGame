# GeneticAlgorithmSnakeGame

 Teaching your computer to play snake through a genetic algorithm in Processing (Java).

 Inspired by @CodingTrain 's video on playing flappy bird with a genetic algorithm. The snakes' brains are simple Neural networks implemented by @kim-marcel [here](https://github.com/kim-marcel/basic_neural_network). To run, make sure you install the G4P add-on libraries, and you're ready to go.

# TODO:
- Train for a while.
- Create sketch to watch a single well-trained snake.
